    "### Introduction to Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- An unsupervised learning problem consists of data without any labels associated with it. I.e. A set of data with no positve or negative labels, just a training set of $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(3)},..., x^{(m)}$ values (a training set with no y values corresponding to each x value)\n",
    "- An unsupervised learning algorithm is used to find patterns/structure in an unlabled dataset\n",
    "    - an algorithm that determines/discovers data grouped into unique clusters is called a clustering algorithm\n",

    "### K-means Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When running the K-means algorithm, the first step is to randomly initialize the **cluster centroids**. The number of cluster centroids, K is equaled to the number of clusters you wish to try to seperate your data into.\n",
    "2. The next step is the cluster assignment step. Each training set will be assigned a cluster centroid based on its proxmity to the centroid.\n",
    "3. The move centroid step moves the centroid to the average of the points assigned to the same centroid.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 until convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formal definition of K-means algorithm\n",
    "    - Input:\n",
    "        - K (number of clusters)\n",

    "            - $c^{(i)}:=$ index (from 1 to K) cluster centroid closest to $x^{(i)}$\n",
    "            - also written as $c^{(i)}:= \\left\\Vert x^{(i)} - \\mu_k \\right\\Vert^2$ = the distance between the xi training example and the cluster centroid. Find the min value of k that minimizes the distances function and assign xi to that cluster centroid k.\n",
